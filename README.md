# Backtesting with Barra data
In this project, I built a fairly realistic backtester that uses the Barra data. The backtester will perform portfolio optimization that includes transaction costs, and implemented with computational efficiency in mind, to allow for a reasonably fast backtest. There is also a use of performance attribution to identify the major drivers of the portfolio's profit-and-loss (PnL).
